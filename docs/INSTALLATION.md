# Installation

For these problems, we use the popular MIPS simulator [MARS](https://dpetersanderson.github.io/Help/MarsHelpIntro.html). Download the MARS jar archive from [GitHub](https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS/releases) and place it somewhere easily accessible. Also install the Java SDK if you do not have it already.
