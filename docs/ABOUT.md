MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture, currently used mostly in video game consoles and routers. It is also a popular architecture in introductory courses and textbooks on computer architecture, due to its simplicity relative to x86 and ARM. Here we use the 32-bit instruction set; a 64-bit instruction set also exists.

This track involves programming in MIPS assembly language, assembled and run on a cross-platform simulator.

An assembly language is a human-readable programming language which represents the series of instructions computers' CPUs execute. As such, it is the most low-level form of programming language, each command having an almost one-to-one correspondance with what the CPU actually understands and does. The process of compiling source-code into an executable program actually consists of translating the source-code into the assembly language accepted by the targeted CPU.

So, basically, you'll be thinking and speaking fluent machine-language!
