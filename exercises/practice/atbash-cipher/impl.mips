# atbash_cipher must:
# - be named atbash_cipher and declared as global
# - read input string from a0
# - follow the convention of using the t0-9 registers for temporary storage
# - (if it uses s0-7 then it is responsible for pushing existing values to the stack then popping them back off before returning)
# - write a zero-terminated string representing the return value to address given in a1
