# egg_count must:
# - be named egg_count and declared as global
# - read input integer from a0
# - follow the convention of using the t0-9 registers for temporary storage
# - (if it wants to use s0-7 then it is responsible for pushing existing values to the stack then popping them back off before returning)
# - write integer result to v0
