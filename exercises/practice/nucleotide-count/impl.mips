# nucleotide_counts must:
# - read input string from a0
# - follow the convention of using the t0-9 registers for temporary storage
# - (if it uses s0-7 then it is responsible for pushing existing values to the stack then popping them back off before returning)
# - write counts for A,C,G,T to the word array with address given in a1
# - write -1 values to the array if the input is invalid
