# value must:
# - be named value and declared as global
# - read address of first input string from a0
# - read address of second input string from a1
# - read address of (possibly empty) third input string from a2
# - follow the convention of using the t0-9 registers for temporary storage
# - (if it uses s0-7 then it is responsible for pushing existing values to the stack then popping them back off before returning)
# - write integer result to v0
