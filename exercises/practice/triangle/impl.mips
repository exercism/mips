# triangle must:
# - be named triangle and declared as global
# - read input integers from a0, a1 and a2
# - follow the convention of using the t0-9 registers for temporary storage
# - (if it wants to use s0-7 then it is responsible for pushing existing values to the stack then popping them back off before returning)
# - write result to v0 as:
#       0 - scalene
#       1 - isoceles
#       2 - equilateral
