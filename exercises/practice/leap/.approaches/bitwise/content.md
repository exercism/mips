This approach always checks if the year is evenly divisible by `4`, `100` and `400` by using the _remainder_ of the division.
Then, it uses the `and` (bitwise AND) and `or` (bitwise OR) instructions to determine whether the year is a leap year.
In order to be able to use the bitwise instructions like they are boolean operators, it converts the remainder checks into
either `1` (`true`) or `0` (`false`) by using the `slt` (set if less than) and `slti` (set if less than immediate) instructions.

| year | year % 4 == 0 | year % 100 != 0 | year % 400 == 0 | is leap year |
| ---- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 2020 | true          | true            | false           | true         |
| 2019 | false         | true            | false           | false        |
| 2000 | true          | false           | true            | true         |
| 1900 | true          | false           | false           | false        |

Equivalent C code:

```c
int is_leap_year(int year) {
    int divisible_by_4       = year % 4 == 0;
    int not_divisible_by_100 = year % 100 != 0;
    int divisible_by_400     = year % 400 == 0;

    return divisible_by_4 && not_divisible_by_100 || divisible_by_400;
}
```

Since this approach always has to perform the three checks, it cannot "short circuit" like the
[traditional boolean chain][approach-boolean-chain] approach and can be considered less efficient.
